# deep-learning-on-Fundus-Image
----
## what we need do in this repository?

1. we create this repository for a project on Fundus-image detect. And we record the learning process with the pace of our project. The context includes deep learning basic theories and algorithms, especially on computer vision and image detect. And we'd like to share our code and learning resources.

#### some resources you can find 

1. [通天塔](http://tongtianta.site/)，a website you can translate English paper to Chinese, and it can help you to quick understand the main idea of a paper when you want to get through it in a short time.
2. [GNN papers](https://github.com/thunlp/GNNPapers) it shows most useful papers on GNN learning, and you can find something you want, and easily review the main method of GNN.
3. [data mining(data analysis)](https://github.com/linyiqun/DataMiningAlgorithm) via this link, you can get some basic algorithms on data mining, and it will help you to quick slove the problems on data analysis if need. code by java.
4. [21天学会caffe](https://github.com/zhaoyongke/Caffe21Days) it includes resources the book 21天实战caffe, so you can use this to help you be familar with caffe quickly.
5. [500 questions on deep learning](https://github.com/scutan90/DeepLearning-500-questions) if you have any questions on deep learning basic knowledge, you can search this project to find an answer, and hopefully it will give you some details you want.
